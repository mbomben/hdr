\chapter{Perspectives}

Finally, the impact of Radiation Damage on Higgs Analysis 
will be presented in Section~\ref{sec:raddamHiggs}; this is a study case that is in 
perspective very important given the excellent luminosity performance of LHC as we write.


For the search of Higgs boson decaying to second generation fermions, for other Higgs sector 
studies, and for many New Physics (NP) scenarios not only outstanding tracking and vertexing of charged particles are needed but  excellent reconstruction of jets is mandatory  too. 
To achieve the highest possible performance tracker information should be exploited at maximum 
together with calorimeter. 
The chief advantages of integrating tracking and calorimetric information into one hadronic reconstruction
step are~\cite{ATLASParticleFlow}:

\begin{itemize}
\item the momentum resolution of the tracker is significantly better than the energy resolution of the
calorimeter for low-energy charged particles
\item the angular resolution of a single charged particle, reconstructed using the tracker is much better
than that of the calorimeter
\item better association of low $p_T$ charged particles to the right jet
\item better association to the correct production vertex so important reduction of degradation due to pile-up  
\end{itemize}

It is clear that the ATLAS tracking and vertexing detector, {\it i.e. the Inner Detector} is of the uttermost importance for all
the searches and studies of ATLAS.
